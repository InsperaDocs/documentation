Inspera Originality offers two environments to operate with the API: development and production. Separate environments are provided to support development and testing workflows. Use the appropriate base URL depending on which environment you are working in.

## Production Environment

This is the live environment intended for real user interactions. Ensure that the correct URL is used in production applications.

```shellscript Development Environment icon=webhook
 https://6x6hep4ey9.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/production
```

## Test Environment

Use this environment for testing and development purposes. It may have different rate limits and data sets compared to the production environment.

```shellscript Test Environment icon=webhook
https://ja0ot1lhh6.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/test
```
