This GET request checks the status of a document. Use the endpoint shown in the request example and include the documentId, which you received from the previous response, as a path parameter. This is a manual process that returns the current status of the specified document.

The only requirement for this request is the `documentId` in the path. This ID matches the identifier returned when the document was first uploaded using the [upload ](/endpoints/upload)endpoint.
